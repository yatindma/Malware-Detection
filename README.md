# Malware-Detection

## Introduction
The term malware is a contraction of malicious software. Put simply, malware is any piece of software that was written with the intent of doing harm to data, devices, or people. In the past few years, the malware industry has grown rapidly, forcing anti-malware groups to build more robust software to detect and terminate these attacks. The major part of protecting a computer system from a malware attack is to identify whether a given piece of file/software is malware.

## Problem Statement
Microsoft has been very active in building anti-malware products over the years and runs its anti-malware utilities over 150 million computers around the world. This generates tens of millions of daily data points to be analyzed as potential malware. To effectively analyze and classify such large amounts of data, we need to group them into families and identify their respective families.

## Data
The data for this project is provided by Microsoft and consists of 9 classes of malware. There are a total of 10,868 .bytes files and 10,868 .asm files, totaling 21,736 files. The total train dataset consists of 200GB data, out of which 50GB is .bytes files and 150GB is .asm files.

## Objectives and Constraints
1. Minimize multi-class error.
2. Multi-class probability estimates.
3. Malware detection should not take hours and block the user's computer. It should finish in a few seconds or a minute.

## Results

| Data Used | Model Applied | Test Logloss |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| BYTES     | KNN          | 0.405799     |
| BYTES     | Logistic Regression | 0.7547623077227 |
| BYTES     | Random Forest | 0.11643996300884493 |
| BYTES     | XGBoost | 0.1087394528780565 |
| BYTES     | XGBoost HyperTuned | 0.08476747746562764 |
| ASM + BYTES | Random Forest | 0.05426446727483882 |
| ASM + BYTES | XGBoost | 0.030941042018366584 |
| ASM + BYTES | CatBoost HyperTuned | 0.0178393584681558 |

## Conclusion
The best results were obtained by using the CatBoost algorithm on both the .bytes and .asm files, with a logloss value of 0.0178393584681558. However, further optimization and experimentation could potentially yield even better results.
